## How to Update for a New Tag/Release

1.  Before creating a new Git tag (e.g., `v1.0.1`):
2.  Add a new column to the table above, titling it `Status (v1.0.1)`.
3.  For each test case, manually execute the test against the codebase intended for `v1.0.1`.
4.  Fill in the status in the new column:
    *   `Pass`: The test case passed as expected.
    *   `Fail`: The test case failed. Add a note or Bug ID.
    *   `Blocked`: The test case could not be executed (e.g., due to an external dependency or an unresolved bug in another area).
    *   `N/A`: The test case is not applicable to this version.
5.  Commit this `TEST_CASES.md` file with a message like "Update manual test statuses for v1.0.1".
