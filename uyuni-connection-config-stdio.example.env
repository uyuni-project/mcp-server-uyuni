# Required: Basic server parameters.
UYUNI_SERVER=example_server:example_port
UYUNI_USER=example_user
UYUNI_PASS=example_password

# Optional: Set to 'false' to disable SSL certificate verification. Defaults to 'true'.
# UYUNI_MCP_SSL_VERIFY=false

# Optional: Set to 'true' to enable tools that perform write actions (e.g., POST requests). Defaults to 'false'.
# UYUNI_MCP_WRITE_TOOLS_ENABLED=false

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Note on Write Tools:** Enabling `UYUNI_MCP_WRITE_TOOLS_ENABLED` allows the execution of state-changing and potentially destructive actions (e.g., removing systems, applying updates). When combined with `UYUNI_MCP_TRANSPORT=http`, this risk is amplified, as any client with network access can perform these actions. Only enable write tools in a trusted environment.

# Optional: Set the transport protocol. Can be 'stdio' (default) or 'http'.
# UYUNI_MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Note on HTTP Transport:** When `UYUNI_MCP_TRANSPORT` is set to `http`, the server runs without authentication. This means any client with network access can execute commands. Only use this mode in a trusted, isolated network environment. For more details, see the Security Policy.

# Optional: Set the path for the server log file. Defaults to logging to the console.
# UYUNI_MCP_LOG_FILE_PATH=/var/log/mcp-server-uyuni.log

# Required to bootstrap new systems into Uyuni via the `add_system` tool.
