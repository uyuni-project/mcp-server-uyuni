### Git Hook

To help you format your commit messages correctly, you can use the provided `prepare-commit-msg.template`.
Copy this file to your local `.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg` directory and make it executable:

```bash
cp prepare-commit-msg.template .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
chmod +x .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
```
This hook will prepend a basic template to your commit message editor.

## Secure Write Operations with a Feature Flag

To enhance security, the server operates in a read-only mode by default. Any tool that performs a write operation (e.g., using a POST request to the Uyuni API) should be disabled unless explicitly enabled by the server operator.

This is enforced using two layers of protection:

Conditional Tool Registration with @write_tool: A custom decorator, @write_tool(), is provided. This decorator only registers the tool with the MCP server if the UYUNI_MCP_WRITE_TOOLS_ENABLED environment variable is set to 'true'. If the variable is false or not set, the tool is never registered and is completely invisible to the LLM. This is the primary mechanism for controlling access to write operations. Usage: Simply replace @mcp.tool() with @write_tool() for any function that modifies state.

Example: @write_tool() async def remove_system(system_identifier: Union[str, int], confirm: bool = False) -> str: """ Removes a system. This is a write operation. """ # ... implementation ...

API Helper Safety Check: As a second layer of defense, the _call_uyuni_api helper function contains a check that will block any request with the POST method if UYUNI_MCP_WRITE_TOOLS_ENABLED is not true. This prevents accidental exposure of a write action if a developer forgets to use the @write_tool decorator.

## Learnings and Patterns for MCP Tool Development

When developing tools for an MCP server, the primary consumer is an LLM. This requires a slightly different approach than traditional API design where a human is reading documentation. The following are some best practices and patterns we've learned that help the LLM understand and use the tools more effectively.

### Be Explicit, Verbose, and Redundant

The LLM relies almost entirely on your tool's docstring and the structure of its return data to understand its purpose and how to use it. You need to be overly explicit to bridge the gap between the user's intent and the tool's function.

*   **Docstrings are your API spec for the LLM:** Be verbose. Clearly describe what the tool does, what each parameter means, and what the structure of the returned data will be.
*   **Design for flexible inputs:** A user might ask, "get updates for system 1000010000" or "get updates for system 'buildhost'". The LLM will infer `1000010000` as an integer and `'buildhost'` as a string. Your tool's signature should handle this (e.g., `system_identifier: Union[str, int]`) and your implementation must be robust enough to resolve either type to the correct system. Crucially, **document this flexibility in the docstring** so the LLM knows it's a valid pattern.
*   **Design clear and self-contained outputs:**
    *   **Avoid ambiguous keys:** Instead of a generic `{'id': 123}`, prefer a specific key like `{'system_id': 123}`. An LLM might not correctly infer that `id` in the context of a system list refers to a `system_id`.
    *   **Include input parameters in the output:** If a tool is called with `get_cpu_of_a_system(system_identifier='buildhost')`, the return dictionary should include that identifier, like `{'system_identifier': 'buildhost', 'cores': 8, ...}`. This helps the LLM connect the result back to the original query and prevents it from "forgetting" which system the data belongs to. Without this, the LLM might correctly call the tool but then claim it doesn't have the information it just received.

### Let the Framework Handle Serialization

FastMCP is designed to correctly serialize your Python objects into the JSON and text formats that the MCP client and LLM expect. You should not do this manually.

*   **Return native Python types:** Your tools should return standard Python objects like dictionaries and lists.
*   **Example:** If your tool needs to return a list of systems, it should return a Python `list` of `dict`s. FastMCP will convert this into a proper JSON array of objects. If you were to call `json.dumps()` on the list yourself, you would return a single JSON *string* that contains an array, which is not what the LLM can parse and use effectively.

### Handle State-Changing Actions with a Confirmation Flow

For any tool that modifies state (applies updates, reboots a system, cancels an action), it is critical to prevent the LLM from taking destructive actions without explicit user consent. A reliable pattern for this is to include a confirmation parameter.

*   **Add a `confirm: bool = False` parameter:** Make it default to `False`.
*   **Return a confirmation prompt:** If `confirm` is `False`, the tool should not perform the action. Instead, it should return a clear string asking the user for confirmation.
*   **Instruct the LLM in the docstring:** The parameter's description must explicitly tell the LLM to ask the user for confirmation and only call the tool again with `confirm=True` after the user has agreed.

**Example from `schedule_system_reboot`:**
```python
@mcp.tool()
async def schedule_system_reboot(system_identifier: Union[str, int], confirm: bool = False) -> str:
    """
    ...
    Args:
        ...
        confirm: False by default. Only set confirm to True if the user has explicetely confirmed. Ask the user for confirmation.
    """
    if not confirm:
        return f"CONFIRMATION REQUIRED: This will reboot system {system_identifier}. Do you confirm?"
    # ... proceed with reboot logic ...
```

### Design for Predictable Failure and Composition

*   **Avoid Raising Exceptions:** LLMs do not handle exceptions well. A tool that raises an unhandled exception can break the conversational flow. Instead of raising an error (e.g., for a 404 Not Found), have the tool return a predictable "empty" or "failed" value. For example, return an empty list (`[]`), an empty dictionary (`{}`), or a dictionary that clearly indicates failure, like `{'has_pending_updates': False, 'updates': []}`.
*   **Embrace Tool Composition:** Build more complex tools by having them call simpler, existing tools. This promotes code reuse and modularity. For instance, `check_all_systems_for_updates` works by iterating through all systems and calling `check_system_updates` for each one. This makes the toolset more powerful and easier to maintain.

### Design Simple and Unambiguous Tool Signatures

*   **Avoid too many required parameters:** If a tool has multiple required parameters (e.g., `add_system(host, activation_key)`), the LLM may not attempt to call it if the user's prompt is simple (e.g., "add system 10.10.10.10"). The LLM might not ask for the missing `activation_key` and will simply fail to use the tool. Strive to design tools with fewer required arguments to make them easier for the LLM to invoke.
*   **Use clear, direct tool names:** Avoid technical jargon that could be ambiguous. For example, a tool named `bootstrap_system` might confuse the LLM into thinking it is being asked to perform the bootstrap action itself, leading it to refuse. A clearer name like `add_system` removes this ambiguity and helps the LLM correctly identify it as a callable tool.

### Be Mindful of LLM and Client Limitations

*   **Token Limits Can Cause Strange Behavior:** When a conversation becomes very long, you might reach the LLM's context token limit. When this happens, the model's responses can become strange or unhelpful. It might repeat information from earlier in the conversation or claim it cannot perform an action it previously could. It often will not explicitly state that the token limit is the issue. If you encounter this behavior, the simplest solution is often to start a new chat session.

### Differentiate Between Client and Server Logging

The server provides two distinct logging mechanisms that serve different purposes. It's important to use the correct one based on the audience for the log message.

*   **Client-Side Logging (`ctx`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To send log messages and progress updates directly to the end-user via the connected client (e.g., Open WebUI). This is for information the user should see.
    *   **How to use:** Call methods on the `ctx` object, like `await ctx.info("Starting process...")`.
    *   **Note:** These are `async` methods and must be awaited.

*   **Server-Side Logging (`logger`):**
    *   **Purpose:** To record detailed information for debugging the server itself. This information is written to the server's log file and is not intended for the end-user.
    *   **How to use:** Use the global `logger` object, like `logger.info("Internal state is X")`.
    *   **Note:** This is a standard, synchronous Python logging call.

**Example:**
```python
@mcp.tool()
async def my_tool(some_input: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    # This message goes to the client (e.g., Open WebUI)
    await ctx.info(f"Starting operation for input: {some_input}")

    # This message goes to the server's log file for debugging
    logger.info(f"Internal state: received input '{some_input}'")

    # ... tool logic ...

    return "Operation complete."

### Handling Elicitation

Elicitation is a powerful capability in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows a server to interactively request information or confirmation from the client or the end-user during the execution of a tool. This is especially useful for tools that require user input, such as an activation key or confirmation before performing an action.

However, elicitation is a relatively new addition to the MCP specification, and not all MCP clients may support it. Therefore, your tools should be designed to handle cases where elicitation is not available and provide fallback mechanisms.

For more information on MCP elicitation, see the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification).

To implement elicitation, you can use the `ctx.elicit()` method within your tool's logic. However, before attempting to use elicitation, you should check if the client supports it using `ctx.session.check_client_capability(types.ClientCapabilities(elicitation=types.ElicitationCapability()))`.

If elicitation is not supported, provide a fallback mechanism, such as returning a message to the user asking for the required information directly.

**Example:**
```python
if ctx.session.check_client_capability(types.ClientCapabilities(elicitation=types.ElicitationCapability())):
    # Use elicitation to prompt the user for information
else:
    # Provide a fallback mechanism
```
```

### Handle Expected Timeouts for Long-Running Actions

Some API calls, like bootstrapping a new system (add_system), can take longer than a typical HTTP timeout. In these cases, a timeout is not a failure but an expected outcome, indicating that a background process has started. The tool should handle this gracefully and inform the user.  

A good pattern for this is:  

1. Define a sentinel object: Create a unique object (e.g., TIMEOUT_HAPPENED = object()) to serve as a special return value. 
2. Add an expect_timeout parameter to the API helper: In your helper function (like _call_uyuni_api), add a boolean parameter (e.g., expect_timeout=False). 
3. Conditionally catch httpx.TimeoutException: Inside the helper, if expect_timeout is True, catch the httpx.TimeoutException, log it as an informational event, and return your sentinel object. If False, treat it as a regular error/warning. 
4. Check for the sentinel in the tool: In the tool function (e.g., add_system), call the helper with expect_timeout=True. Then, check if the result is the sentinel object. If it is, return a user-friendly message explaining that the process has started and may take some time.  

Example from _call_uyuni_api and add_system: 
```python 
# In server.py 
TIMEOUT_HAPPENED = object() 

# ... inside the add_system tool ... 
api_result = await _call_uyuni_api(..., expect_timeout=True) 
if api_result is TIMEOUT_HAPPENED:

return "System addition process started. It may take some time..." 
```

### Design for Predictable Failure and Composition

Avoid Raising Exceptions: LLMs do not handle exceptions well. A tool that raises an unhandled exception can break the conversational flow. Instead of raising an error (e.g., for a 404 Not Found), have the tool return a predictable "empty" or "failed" value. For example, return an empty list ([]), an empty dictionary ({}), or a dictionary that clearly indicates failure, like {'has_pending_updates': False, 'updates': []}.

### Design Simple and Unambiguous Tool Signatures

Avoid too many required parameters: If a tool has multiple required parameters (e.g., add_system) the LLM won't execute it if the user's prompt is simple (e.g., "add system 10.10.10.10"). The LLM might not ask for the missing activation_key and will simply fail to use it. Instead, make the required parameters optional, by setting some default value, and then check if the parameters have been provided. If not, return a message to the user asking for them. This way, the LLM will execute the tool even if you have not provided with the parameters.
